Selected SICP Exercise Solutions
================================

These are some of my solutions to the coding exercises in the
[Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd
Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. This book, SICP (also called the
Wizard Book), is a classic text in computer science.

This is not meant to be a complete solution guide. Only exercises that
ask the reader to write some code are included; exercises in
mathematical proof as well as exercises asking the reader to examine
or run a given code listing are for the most part omitted.


Running
-------

Each source file can be executed using a Scheme interpreter. The
implementation that I am using is [MIT
Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), but other
implementations should also work.
