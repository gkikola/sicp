Selected SICP Exercise Solutions
================================

These are some of my solutions to the exercises in the [Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs, 2nd
Edition](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)
by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. This book, SICP (also called the
Wizard Book), is a classic text in computer science.


Running
-------

Each source file can be executed using a Scheme interpreter. The
implementation that I use is [MIT
Scheme](https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/), but other
implementations should also work.
